# Deepfake_Xception_Inception_CNN
## Comparison
DeepFake-Detection-Project
We are trying to detect deepfake videos. Here we are using a dataset from Kaggle where the annotations are stored in a json file in the train sample videos folder.

Steps:

### Reading the videos and taking images from it
### Reading the label in the json file and store the image in a folder according to it's label
### Converting the image to an array and splitting the data into train and test
### Customizing the Xception, Inception_resnet_v2 and training the data on it
### Testing
